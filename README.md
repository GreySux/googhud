# This is googHUD! A hud designed for Team Fortress 2, specifically with competitive in mind to give the most important information to the player without overbearing them. The idea is to be simplistic but clean. 

To install, press the green "Code" on github, then download ZIP. Once downloaded, open/unzip the file and drag the folder "googhud-main" into \Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

Currently 1.2 release. this upodate includes:
- new customization menu
- new customization folder with many options such as health, chat, scoreboard, etc.
- new and better file layouts
- custom fonts
- fixes

1.2 is the most stable release to date, with plenty of bug fixes and what not. as always, dm me any issues you have!

this is still not even close to where i want this hud to be, and more updates are to come. major plans include:

- more and better customization folder options
- more and better customization menu options
- tf2hudeditor integration
- medigun type icons
- probably some more stuff im forgetting because im pushing this update at 4:00 AM

I've been working on this by myself but if anyone is interested in helping out or even providing feedback, I'd really appreciate it! my discord is greysucks
