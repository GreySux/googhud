#This is googHUD! A hud designed for Team Fortress 2, specifically with competitive in mind to give the most important information to the player without overbearing them. The idea is to be simplistic but clean. 

Currently 0.3.1 release,there are still bugs and things that need adjusting. This should be considered a beta version, and while it is stable for competitive usage, you may encounter some bugs.

Thanks to the following folks who i borrowed hud elements from:

- cibacity - cibahud (base)
- static - voidhud
- quickkennedy - cutehud
- peaches - xhud
- jarateking - HUD Reference

TO DO:
- add more resoution compatability (currently only 1920x1080, 2560x1440 in the works)
- loadout overhaul
- class selection overhaul
- main menu / pause menu overhaul
- disguise menu overhaul / fix
- plenty of bug fixes for various things
- minmode compatability
- customization friendly interface
- more custom stuff when i find the time

I've been working on this by myself but if anyone is interested in helping out or even providing feedback, I'd really appreciate it! my discord is greysucks.
