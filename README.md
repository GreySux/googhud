# This is googHUD! A hud designed for Team Fortress 2, specifically with competitive in mind to give the most important information to the player without overbearing them. The idea is to be simplistic but clean. 

To install, press the green "Code" on github, then download ZIP. Once downloaded, open/unzip the file and drag the folder "googhud-main" into \Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

Currently 1.3 release. this upodate includes:
- a couple fixes
- transparent viewmodel support
- uber and kritz counters

As always, dm me any issues you have!

- quickkennedy - cutehud
- peaches - xhud
- mrcolour - colourhud
- whisker - budhud

this hud has progressed a lot, but there are still more updates are to come. major plans include:

- more and better customization folder options
- more and better customization menu options
- tf2hudeditor integration
- new fonts

I've been working on this by myself but if anyone is interested in helping out or even providing feedback, I'd really appreciate it! my discord is greysucks
